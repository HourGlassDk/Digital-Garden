# Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

These are working notes on reinforcement learning concepts. This is a draft note that will only appear in development mode.

## Key Concepts

### Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- States (S)
- Actions (A)
- Transition function P(s'|s,a)
- Reward function R(s,a,s')
- Discount factor γ

### Value Functions
- **State Value Function V(s)**: Expected return starting from state s
- **Action Value Function Q(s,a)**: Expected return starting from state s, taking action a

### Policy
A policy π(a|s) maps states to actions. Goal is to find optimal policy π*.

## Common Algorithms

### Q-Learning
Off-policy TD control algorithm:
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```

### Policy Gradient Methods
Directly optimize the policy rather than value functions.

### Actor-Critic Methods
Combine value function approximation with policy optimization.

## Applications
- Game playing (AlphaGo)
- Robotics control
- Resource management
- Recommendation systems

## Questions to Explore
- How do RL agents handle exploration vs exploitation?
- What are the safety considerations for RL in real-world applications?
- How can we incorporate human feedback into RL systems?
