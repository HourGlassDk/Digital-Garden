# Introduction to Neural Networks

This is a template for your notes. Notes are for exploring topics you're still learning about, with less opinion and more focus on understanding.

## Basic Concepts

### What is a Neural Network?
- A computational model inspired by biological neural networks
- Consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers
- Learns patterns through training on data

### Key Components
- **Input Layer**: Receives the initial data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process the data (can be multiple)
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final result
- **Weights**: Parameters that are adjusted during training
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear transformations at each neuron

## Common Architectures

### Feedforward Neural Networks
- Simplest type of neural network
- Information flows in one direction
- Good for basic classification tasks

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Specialized for processing grid-like data (e.g., images)
- Use convolutional layers to detect features
- Applications: image recognition, computer vision

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Designed for sequential data
- Have memory of previous inputs
- Applications: natural language processing, time series

## Training Process

1. **Forward Propagation**: Input data flows through the network
2. **Loss Calculation**: Compare predictions to actual values
3. **Backpropagation**: Calculate gradients
4. **Weight Update**: Adjust weights using optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent)

## Questions to Explore

- How do different activation functions affect performance?
- What causes vanishing/exploding gradients in deep networks?
- How can we interpret what a neural network has learned?
